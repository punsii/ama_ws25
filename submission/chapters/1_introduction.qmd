# Life expectancy: motivation and scope

We analyze the WHO “Life Expectancy” dataset (Kaggle) with 1 649 country‑year records (193 countries, 2000–2015). The core analyses use the 2014 cross‑section (n = 131) to avoid longitudinal dependence while retaining global coverage.

- **Outcome and predictors.** The target is `life_expectancy` (years). Predictors span:

  1. **Demography & mortality:** adult mortality, infant/under‑five deaths, HIV/AIDS.
  2. **Immunization & burden:** HepB, Polio, Diphtheria coverage; measles cases.
  3. **Socio‑economic & investment:** GDP per capita, health expenditure (% of GDP and % of government budget), income composition (HDI component), schooling.
  4. **Nutrition & status:** BMI, thinness indicators, development status (0/1).

- **Descriptive signal (2014 cross‑section, standardized):** life expectancy mean 70.5 years (SD 8.6; range 48.1–89.0). Strongest positive correlations with the target are income composition (r$\approx$0.89), schooling (r$\approx$0.80), BMI (r$\approx$0.56), alcohol (r$\approx$0.53), and status (r$\approx$0.50). Strongest negatives are adult mortality (r$\approx$−0.77), HIV/AIDS (r$\approx$−0.62), thinness 5–9y (r$\approx$−0.46), thinness 10–19y (r$\approx$−0.44), and under‑five deaths (r$\approx$−0.23). Multicollinearity hotspots include infant_deaths–under_five_deaths (r$\approx$0.995), GDP–percentage_expenditure (r$\approx$0.95), thinness pair (r$\approx$0.94), and income_composition–schooling (r$\approx$0.92).

- **Outlier screening (2014, z‑scores):** 25 of 131 rows exceed |z|>3 on at least one predictor, concentrated in immunization rates (HepB, Diphtheria, Polio) and expenditure/GDP. We therefore report both IQR- and Z‑based checks before final models.

- **Research questions.**

  1. Which predictors have the most significant explanatory power for cross‑country life expectancy in 2014?
  2. What interactions and nonlinearities exist in the cross-sectional data?
  3. How do parsimonious vs. richer linear models compare on train vs. 5‑fold CV error?
  4. Do key assumptions (linearity, normality, homoscedasticity, independence, leverage) hold, and how should violations be addressed?
  5. How sensitive are results to outlier handling (IQR vs. Z‑score) and to multicollinearity among correlated blocks (HDI vs. schooling; immunization rates)?

- **Analytical flow.**

  1.  **Preprocessing:** header normalization, type conversion, 2014 aggregation, log transforms for skewed counts, z‑scoring of numeric predictors; documented missing‑value and outlier handling.
  2. **Exploration:** correlation structure and grouped PCA to quantify redundancy and dominant dimensions.
  3. **Modelling:** baseline univariate OLS, core multivariate OLS, assumption diagnostics, CV; supervised PCA + regression as an alternative to mitigate multicollinearity.
  4. **Interpretation:** effect sizes with uncertainty, practical relevance, and stated limitations.

- **Roadmap.** Preprocessing (Ch. 2) → PCA (Ch. 3) → Clustering (Ch. 4) → Regression (Ch. 5). Each chapter cites the generating notebook(s) for figures/tables to keep provenance explicit.
