## Dimensionality reduction

Performing analysis on large invaried data often leads to significant noise, unwanted or unneeded data in further analysis.
To combat this a dimensionality reduction can be performed on the dataset using a PCA.
The goal here is to make sure that unneeded columns are merged together if they share variance, thus reducing our column size.

### Methodology

So the process we went with for data concatination was as follows:
- Extract columns you want to remove from original dataframe (DF) and put them into their own dataframe (DF-A) and make a dataframe containing the removed columns (DF-B)
- Perform a PCA with dimensionality of 1 on the columns (DF-A).
- Extract the loadings from the PCA.
- Take the loadings and lift them to the power of 2 effectively normalising them.
- Row by Row create new row based in (DF-B) based on weighted sum of the analysed columns row.

### Implementation


### Findings

Finding candidates for column concatinations originally involved looking at the descriptions of the columns.
One candidates that stood out were the columns 'Hepatitis B' , 'Polio' and 'Diphtheria' all having a minimum value of around 1-3 and a maximum value of 99.
This means that there is a high likelyhood of this data is correlated.
The meta-data gathered from concatinating these columns returns the values of:

```
The first principal component (PC1) explains 69.48% of the variance within these columns.
       feature   loading
0  Hepatitis B  0.263158
1  Diphtheria   0.381350
2        Polio  0.355491
```

Based on these values we get a weight values for the first PC column of around 0.25 to 0.4, which roughly makes sense. Most of them ringe around the value of ```0.33``` which should make sense for correlated variables.
Secondly we also get an explained variance of 69.48% for the first column. Which is high showing a strong correlation between each column.
However not high enough to where you could safely concat them with no pratical dataloss.

In our case since we aren't as much intrested in the which deceases are the biggest contributors to life expecency. We decided to concat the columns, perhaps with the ability to do further analysis on which vaccine is best for life expectancy.
The reason for ommiting this analysis point is that the variance between them is to similar in this dataset so we dont belive the time is at the given moment best spent there.

Other columns concatination candiates are way more clear cut.
