# Life Expectancy

This report documents our multivariate analysis of the WHO “Life Expectancy” country-year dataset, with a focus on a 2014 cross-section to support correlation analysis, PCA, clustering, and regression in a consistent setting.


## Introduction

- [Introduction](chapters/1_introduction.qmd) — Motivation, dataset overview, and the cross-sectional framing (2014).

## Data preparation

- [Year Selection](chapters/2_preproc_year_selection.qmd) — Completeness and anomaly diagnostics used to select a representative year.
- [Data Preprocessing](chapters/2_preprocessing.qmd) — Cleaning pipeline, missing-value handling, transforms, and standardization used throughout.
- [Outlier Detection and Cleaning](chapters/2_outlier_detection.qmd) — IQR, z-score, and Isolation Forest screening on the longitudinal panel.

## Exploratory structure

- [Correlation Analysis](chapters/3_correlation.qmd) — Correlation structure, multicollinearity, and feature-group motivation for PCA/regression.
- [Principal Component Analysis](chapters/3_pca.qmd) — Dimensionality reduction and PCA-based feature combination/interpretation.

## Clustering

- [Clustering](chapters/4_clustering.qmd) — K-means clustering (with PCA visualization) on standardized country profiles.

## Regression and open questions

- [Regression Analysis](chapters/5_regression.qmd) — OLS models with PCA-based reduction, diagnostics, and year-based out-of-sample evaluation.
- [Open Questions](chapters/5_open_questions.qmd) — Remaining methodological choices and items to clarify.
